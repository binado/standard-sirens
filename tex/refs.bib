We argued that combining the reconstructed volumes with positions and redshifts of possible host galaxies can provide large-aperture but small field of view instruments with a manageable list of targets to search for optical or infrared emission. In this Supplement, we document the new HEALPix-based file format for 3D localizations of gravitational-wave transients. We include Python sample code to show the reader how to perform simple manipulations of the 3D sky maps and extract ranked lists of likely host galaxies. Finally, we include mathematical details of the rapid volume reconstruction algorithm.}

  abstract = {Next generation ground-based gravitational-wave detectors will observe binary black hole (BBH) mergers up to redshift \$zrsim 10\$ , probing the evolution of compact binary (CB) mergers across cosmic time. Here, we present a new data-driven model to estimate the cosmic merger rate density (MRD) evolution of CBs, by coupling catalogs of CB mergers with observational constraints on the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) density and on the metallicity evolution of the universe. We adopt catalogs of CB mergers derived from recent N-body and population-synthesis simulations, to describe the MRD of CBs formed in young star clusters (hereafter, dynamical CBs) and in the field (hereafter, isolated CBs). The local MRD of dynamical BBHs is \$\{\{ {\textbackslash}mathcal R \}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{BBH\}\}=\{64\}\_\{-20\}{\textasciicircum}\{+34\}\$ Gpc-3 yr-1, consistent with the 90\% credible interval from the first and second observing runs (O1 and O2) of the LIGO-Virgo collaboration, and with the local MRD of isolated BBHs ( \$\{\{ {\textbackslash}mathcal R \}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{BBH\}\}=\{50\}\_\{-37\}{\textasciicircum}\{+71\}\$ Gpc-3 yr-1). The local MRD of dynamical and isolated black hole-neutron star binaries is \$\{\{ {\textbackslash}mathcal R \}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{BHNS\}\}=\{41\}\_\{-23\}{\textasciicircum}\{+33\}\$ and \$\{49\}\_\{-34\}{\textasciicircum}\{+48\}\$ Gpc-3 yr-1, respectively. Both values are consistent with the upper limit inferred from O1 and O2. Finally, the local MRD of dynamical binary neutron stars (BNSs, \$\{\{ {\textbackslash}mathcal R \}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{BNS\}\}=\{151\}\_\{-38\}{\textasciicircum}\{+59\}\$ Gpc-3 yr-1) is a factor of two lower than the local MRD of isolated BNSs ( \$\{\{ {\textbackslash}mathcal R \}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{BNS\}\}=\{283\}\_\{-75\}{\textasciicircum}\{+97\}\$ Gpc-3 yr-1). The MRD for all CB classes grows with redshift, reaching its maximum at \$z{\textbackslash}in [1.5,2.5]\$ , and then decreases. This trend springs from the interplay between cosmic SFR, metallicity evolution, and delay time of binary compact objects.},

  abstract   = {Gravitational-wave detectors are starting to reveal the redshift evolution of the binary black hole (BBH) merger rate, R BBH(z). We make predictions for R BBH(z) as a function of black hole mass for systems originating from isolated binaries. To this end, we investigate correlations between the delay time and black hole mass by means of the suite of binary population synthesis simulations, COMPAS. We distinguish two channels: the common envelope (CE), and the stable Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF) channel, characterized by whether the system has experienced a common envelope or not. We find that the CE channel preferentially produces BHs with masses below about 30 M ⊙ and short delay times (t delay ≲ 1 Gyr), while the stable RLOF channel primarily forms systems with BH masses above 30 M ⊙ and long delay times (t delay ≳ 1 Gyr). We provide a new fit for the metallicity-dependent specific star formation rate density based on the Illustris TNG simulations, and use this to convert the delay time distributions into a prediction of R BBH(z). This leads to a distinct redshift evolution of R BBH(z) for high and low primary BH masses. We furthermore find that, at high redshift, R BBH(z) is dominated by the CE channel, while at low redshift, it contains a large contribution ({\textasciitilde}40\%) from the stable RLOF channel. Our results predict that, for increasing redshifts, BBHs with component masses above 30 M ⊙ will become increasingly scarce relative to less massive BBH systems. Evidence of this distinct evolution of R BBH(z) for different BH masses can be tested with future detectors.},

Assuming that the progenitor formation rate follows the star formation rate (SFR), the data favor that 43100 of mergers have delay times {\textless}4.5 Gyr (90 credibility). Adopting a model for the metallicity evolution, we derive joint constraints for the metallicity-dependence of the BBH formation efficiency and the distribution of time delays between formation and merger. Short time delays are favored regardless of the assumed metallicity dependence, although the preference for short delays weakens as we consider stricter low-metallicity thresholds for BBH formation. For a p() 1 time delay distribution and a progenitor formation rate that follows the SFR without metallicity dependence, we find that min {\textless} 2.2 Gyr, whereas considering only the low-metallicity Z {\textless} 0.3 Z SFR, min {\textless} 3.0 Gyr (90 credibility). Alternatively, if we assume long time delays, the progenitor formation rate must peak at higher redshifts than the SFR. For example, for a p() 1 time delay distribution with min 4 Gyr, the inferred progenitor rate peaks at z {\textgreater} 3.9 (90 credibility). Finally, we explore whether the inferred formation rate and time delay distribution vary with BBH mass.},

  abstract  = {We present a new constraint on the Hubble constant H 0 using a sample of well-localized gravitational-wave (GW) events detected during the first three LIGO/Virgo observing runs as dark standard sirens. In the case of dark standard sirens, a unique host galaxy is not identified, and the redshift information comes from the distribution of potential host galaxies. From the third LIGO/Virgo observing run detections, we add the asymmetric-mass binary black hole GW190412 and the high-confidence GW candidates S191204r, S200129m, and S200311bg to the sample of dark standard sirens analyzed in Palmese et al. Our sample contains the top 20% (based on localization) GW events and candidates to date with significant coverage by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Legacy Survey. We combine the H 0 posterior for eight dark siren events, finding  (68% highest density interval) for a prior in H 0 uniform between [20, 140] km s−1 Mpc−1. This result shows that a combination of eight well-localized dark sirens combined with an appropriate galaxy catalog is able to provide an H 0 constraint that is competitive (∼20% versus 18% precision) with a single bright standard siren analysis (i.e., assuming the electromagnetic counterpart) using GW170817. When combining the posterior with that from GW170817, we obtain . This result is broadly consistent with recent H 0 estimates from both the cosmic microwave background and supernovae.}

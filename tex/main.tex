\section{\label{sec:introduction}Introduction} The idea of using gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary mergers to measure
cosmological parameters was first introduced by Bernard Schutz in 1986~\cite{Schutz:1986gp}. These
signals directly provide a measurement of the luminosity distance measurement to the source, which
is therefore independent of the cosmic distance ladder. With the addition of redshift information,
measurements can therefore be made of those cosmological parameters which impact the expansion
history of the Universe, such as the Hubble constant ($H_0$). This approach is independent of all
other local measurements to date.

The standard siren method probes the expansion history of the universe with the distance-redshift
relation, with which one can infer the cosmological parameters such as $H_0$ and the dark energy
equation of state parameter $w$:~\cite{Hogg:1999ad}

\begin{align}
	\label{eq:intro:distance-redshift-relation}
	D_l(z)           & = (1+z)\frac{c}{H_0 \sqrt{\Omega_{K}}} \sinh \left[ \sqrt{\Omega_{K}} \int_0^z \frac{H_0}{H(z') dz'}\right] \\
	\nonumber
	\frac{H(z)}{H_0} & = \sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z)^3 + \Omega_K (1+z)^2 + \Omega_{de} (1+z)^{3(1+w)}}.
\end{align}

To lighten notation, we have omitted the 0-subscript next to the $\Omega_i$'s, although they
correspond to the present day values in the above equation. Note that
using~\eqref{eq:intro:distance-redshift-relation} requires specifying a cosmological model.

\subsection{Gravitational-wave distances}

The accuracy of the GW luminosity distance measurement is typically of the order of 10\%. The main
source of uncertainty comes from the degeneracy between the distance and inclination angle of the
source. The latter is defined as the angle between the line-of-sight vector from the source to the
detector and the orbital-angular momentum of the binary system.

\subsection{Assigning redshifts to GW sources}

From the GW data, it is possible to infer the luminosity distance to the binary source, but not the
redshift, as the latter comes degenerate with the chirp mass in the GW waveform modelling. It is
therefore necessary to complement it with another source of information that provides the redshift
measurement. Multi-messenger observations, such as neutron star mergers with electromagnetic
counterparts like short gamma-ray bursts or kilonovae, provide the most straight-forward
measurement \cite{Holz:2005df,Dalal:2006qt}. An electromagnetic counterpart like a kilonova can
typically be pinpointed to a specific galaxy, thereby identifying the host galaxy of the GW merger.
The GW signal provides the distance to the host galaxy, while its electromagnetic spectrum provides
the redshift. These sources are typically referred to as bright sirens. So far, the only confirmed
such event has been the binary neutron star detection GW170817, which occurred so exceptionally
close to our galaxy - at $d \sim 40$Mpc - that a direct, model-independent estimation of $H_0$ with
Hubble's law,

\begin{equation}
	v_H = H_0 d,
\end{equation}

could be made by measuring the Hubble flow velocity $v_H$, resulting in $H_0 = 70.0^{+12.0}_{-8.0}$
km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$~\cite{LIGOScientific:2017adf}.

As stated above, almost all GW events have been detected without an EM counterpart. These
\textit{dark sirens} can be used to probe the expansion of the universe provided that they are
complemented with an external redshift measurement. In his original paper, Schutz suggested that
this information could be inferred from galaxy catalogs: each galaxy contributes to a hypothetical
measurement of $H_0$, such that the galaxy structure within a GW event's localisation volume is
reflected in the H0 posterior it produces. How informative the individual events are will depend
strongly on their localisation volumes. By combining the contributions of many events, the true
value of $H_0$ will be measured as other values will statistically average out. Such analyses have
been carried out in the literature,
see~\cite{DelPozzo:2011vcw,Chen:2017rfc,LIGOScientific:2018gmd,Gray:2019ksv,DES:2019ccw,DES:2020nay}.

\section{\label{sec:framework}Statistical framework}

In gravitational-wave astronomy, one subject of interest is extracting the distributional
properties of a population of sources based on a set of observations which are drawn from that
distribution. Any methodology that leads to unbiased estimates of the population parameters must
simultaneously account for measurement uncertainties and selection effects. One way with which the
latter affects the observed population is a Mamquist bias: the loudest or brightest sources are
more likely to be detected. The standard formalism for extracting the true source population
parameters by incorporating these biases in the analysis is frequently labeled as Hierarchical
Bayesian inference, see~\cite{Loredo:2004nn,Mandel:2018mve, Vitale:2020aaz}.

We use the [GLADE+](https://glade.elte.hu/) catalog, which combines data from six astronomical catalogues.

The data can be downloaded with the `get_catalog` script. Post-processing has not been implemented yet, but a benchmark to study is the [`gwcosmo` implementation](https://git.ligo.org/lscsoft/gwcosmo/-/blob/master/scripts_galaxy_catalogs/GLADE%2B/create_glade%2B.py).
